Matching Game
================

In this project, a simple game has been written using html, css and
JavaScript. The board shown at the beginning of the game is the next
one:

The game board consists of 16 cards arranged in a grid. The deck is made
up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one
side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face
down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at
a time to locate the ones that match.

Each turn:

  - The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
  - The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the
    corresponding card with the same symbol.
  - If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
  - If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## How To Play

The player must click on the cards to flip them over:

Once 2 cards are clicked:

  - If they do not match, both cards are flipped face down with a short
    animation.

  - If they match, both cards stay flipped over and will become green.
